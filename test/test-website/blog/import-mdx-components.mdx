We should be able to import other MDX Components.

Using the code below we can import the `hello-world.mdx` file which contains the text "Hello World".

```tsx
import HelloWorld from "../components/hello-world.mdx";

<HelloWorld />;
```

import HelloWorld from "../components/hello-world.mdx";

If all goes well we should see "Hello World" below!

<HelloWorld />
