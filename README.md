# mdx-blog (WIP)

Build a blog with MDX support. Compile to HTML or serve on demand. Right now still a rough work in progress.

## TODO

- [ ] MDX options provided by user
- [ ] MDX components
- [ ] Configurable layout
- [ ] Implement and test serve using https://github.com/ije/html
- [ ] Possible to use `mdx.evaluate` and import other `mdx` components? Would likely have to rewrite imports / transpile those to `js` temporarily.
- [ ] Deploy with real blog
